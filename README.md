# SuperGemini Plugin for Gemini CLI

This plugin integrates the power of SuperGemini templates directly into the Gemini CLI, allowing you to run complex, multi-dimensional commands as native CLI subcommands.

## Installation

> **Prerequisites:** You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+) and npm installed.

To install the plugin, clone this repository (or use your local copy) and run the global npm installation command from the project's root directory.

1.  **Navigate to the plugin directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/supergemini-plugin
    ```

2.  **Install globally using npm:**
    ```bash
    npm install -g .
    ```
    *Note: On Linux or macOS, you may need to prepend `sudo` if you encounter permission errors (`sudo npm install -g .`).*

3.  **Verify the installation:**
    After installation, you can list all active Gemini extensions to ensure it was loaded correctly.
    ```bash
    gemini --list-extensions
    ```
    You should see `supergemini-plugin` in the list.

## How it Works

This plugin automatically scans your `~/.gemini/commands/` directory for SuperGemini's `.md` template files. It then dynamically registers each template as a new `super-*` subcommand within the Gemini CLI.

For example, the `analyze.md` template becomes the `gemini super-analyze` command. The plugin correctly handles positional arguments and flags (e.g., `--env prod`, `--think-hard`).

## Usage Examples

Once installed, you can call any SuperGemini command directly from your terminal.

**Basic Example:**
```bash
gemini super-analyze "my-source-code-folder"
```

**Advanced Example with Flags:**
The plugin correctly parses and passes along all flags to the SuperGemini template.
```bash
gemini super-deploy . --rollback --ultrathink --persona-analyst
```
